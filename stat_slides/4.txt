<p> Now, lets talk about the "statistics" and its difference with "probability".</p>

<p>Assume we have a basket with different colorful marbles. We already know how many marbles from each color is in the basket.
 Using probability, we can predict what would be a distribution of marbles when one took a handful of them from that basket.</p>

<p> Another scenario could be, that we took a handful of marbles from the basket. We know what is inside our hand.
Now, given that, what can we estimate about content of the basket. We can answer this question using statistics. </p>
